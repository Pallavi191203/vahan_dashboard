# Vahan Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Vahan Dashboard** is an interactive data visualization tool that automates the scraping and processing of vehicle registration data from the [Vahan portal](https://vahan.parivahan.gov.in/).

## 🚀 Features

* **Automated Data Update**

  * One-click script to scrape and process the latest data
* **Interactive Dashboard**

  * Filters by **date range**, **vehicle category**, and **manufacturer**
* **Investor Metrics**

  * Year-over-Year (YoY) and Quarter-over-Quarter (QoQ) growth
* **Data Export**

  * Download filtered results as CSV
* **Visualizations**

  * Line & bar charts for trends
  * Percentage change indicators

## 📊 Data Assumptions

* Data is sourced from the official **Vahan dashboard**.
* Missing data for certain states/UTs is assumed unavailable rather than zero.
* YoY and QoQ growth calculations are based on available data points only.

---

## 📅 Feature Roadmap

* [ ] Deploy as a hosted dashboard
* [ ] Add state-level breakdown
* [ ] Email alerts for unusual growth patterns
* [ ] AI-powered anomaly detection
